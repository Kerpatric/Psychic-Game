The Psychic game

1. the main screen displays instructions, Wins:, Losses:, Guesses Left:, and Your Guesses so far:
//To do this we need to write the permenant HTML, and then in javaScript define the 4 variables and give them a value of 0 and 10 for Guesses left

2. we need to make the computer pick a random letter in the alphabet
//To do this we need to first make an array of strings for each letter in the alphabet, then we need to make the computer chose a random index from that string.

3. then the player choses a letter by pressing a key
//To do this we must create an on key press event in the javaScript

4. the player has 10 chances to guess before the computer picks another random letter
//Once the player reaches 10 guesses we need to write a function that can reset the counter to 10

5. if the player does not guess correctly in 10 guesses we need to add one to the loss counter
//inside the loop we need to set up a statement where the ++ attribute is called upon if it comes back as false

6. if the player guesses correctly we need to add one to the wins counter
//this will also go in the for loop as an else if, and will also use the ++ attribute

7. when the player guesses a letter we need to add it to the list of guesses so far
//This will probably be a function inside the for loop which will add the letter pressed to an array and write it to the HTML

8. when the player makes a wrong guess we need to remove one from the guesses left counter
// another one that goes in the for loop that will use the -- attribute 

9. when the player reaches 10 guesses we need to reset the guesses left counter
// This will go inside the loop and should reset the counter to 10

10. when the player makes a correct guess we need to reset the guesses left and guesses so far list
// This will close off the loop and reset 2 of our counters by writing to the HTML directly
