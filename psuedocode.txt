The Psychic game

we need to make the computer pick a random letter in the alphabet

then the player choses a letter by pressing a key

the player has 10 chances to guess before the computer picks another random letter

if the player does not guess correctly in 10 guesses we need to add one to the loss counter

if the player guesses correctly we need to add one to the wins counter

when the player guesses a letter we need to add it to the list of guesses so far

when the player makes a wrong guess we need to remove one from the guesses left counter

when the player reaches 10 guesses we need to reset the guesses left counter

when the player makes a correct guess we need to reset the guesses left and guesses so far list
